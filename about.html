		<p>Hi there! I'm Farbs, the guy responsible for all of the writeups you see on this site.
			I've been honing and improving my pen-testing skills since 2015, and always strive for
			more improvement each day. This site was created solely to help me share the methods I've
			found for exploiting HackTheBox boxes. It also helps jog my memory on previous exploits and concepts
			I might have slowly forgotten over time. Hopefully you enjoy what I do, and thanks for stopping by!
